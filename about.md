_"Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live."_

Hi, my name is Jannik. I started my journey in software development with a vocational training as an IT specialist in application development, followed by a degree in computer science. I've been developing software for about 20 years now and currently work in the C#/.NET ecosystem at TRIOVEGA GmbH.

I'm a passionate IT enthusiast with a deep curiosity for everything related to computer science â€” there's no area in tech that doesn't spark my interest. In my free time, I enjoy diving into cybersecurity topics and solving Capture the Flag challenges on platforms like TryHackMe and HackTheBox.

I also like exploring new technologies and concepts, and often find myself reading technical books on a variety of topics. Staying curious and learning something new is a big part of what keeps me motivated.

I enjoy working in a team environment and strongly value clean, maintainable code. Writing software that is not only functional but also elegant and easy to understand is something I care deeply about.
